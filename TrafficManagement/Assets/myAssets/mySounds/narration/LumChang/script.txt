angry: 
Hey what are you doing, get out of there!

Can you be faster? We need to complete the job!



friendly like a teacher:

Hi, today we have a load of rebar that we need to offload from the trailer.
Look at your left hand for the menu.

Click on the PTW button on your menu, and check if this lifting job has been approved.

The lifting job has been approved by the safety team. 
Let's check if the hoist and chain sling are serviceable for use.

Very good! Our lifting gear is safe to use. Hook the chain sling to the hoist

Now, let's make sure our unloading is safe. Click on the area check button.

Pick up the cone and sticks, and put them in the correct place.
The rigger will hook up the rebar to prepare for lifting.

Good job! Now, let's hold the tagline and tell the crane operator to lift the load up 30cm.

Well done, we are ready to proceed. 
Make sure no one is in the lifting zone, and the weather is suitable to continue the job.
Then, hold the tagline to continue lifting.

Very good, give a thumbs up to your lifting supervisor if you're ready to continue.
